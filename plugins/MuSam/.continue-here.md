# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for MuSam. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Multi-region sample sequencer with crossfading playback
- Parameters specified: 5 regions with local parameters (Pitch, Filter, AD Envelope, Pan), global parameters (Speed, Volume)
- UI vision captured: Liquid Glass aesthetic, color-coded regions, central waveform display, 8-step visual sequencer
- Use cases identified: Glitch effects, ambient textures, drum deconstruction

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Sampler/Effect
- Core concept: 5 color-coded regions with independent processing, 8-step sequencer, crossfade transitions
- Inspiration: Spectres (Slate+Ash), Apple Liquid Glass aesthetic
- Playback: Crossfade mode between regions, global loop mode, no velocity sensitivity
