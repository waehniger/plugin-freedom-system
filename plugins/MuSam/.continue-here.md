# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 1 - Foundation + Shell Complete

Build system created and all 53 parameters implemented with APVTS. Ready for DSP implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: Sampler/Effect
- Professional examples researched: Spectres (Slate+Ash), Kontakt, Ableton Simpler
- JUCE modules identified: juce::AudioFormatManager, juce::dsp::IIR::Filter, juce::AudioBuffer
- DSP feasibility verified
- Parameter ranges researched
- Complexity score: 4.2 (Complex)
- Strategy: Phase-based implementation (7 phases total: 4 DSP + 3 GUI)
- Plan documented

**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- CMakeLists.txt created with JUCE 8 integration and WebView support
- PluginProcessor.h/cpp created with APVTS structure
- All 53 parameters implemented (2 global + 40 region + 11 sequencer)
- PluginEditor.h/cpp created (minimal placeholder for Stage 1)
- State management (getStateInformation/setStateInformation) implemented

**Research Summary:**
- 8 DSP components identified (Sample Loader, Region Playback, Pitch Shifter, Filter, Envelope, Pan, Sequencer, Crossfade)
- Pitch shifting: Granular synthesis approach (good quality/performance balance)
- Sample loading: Background thread loading with atomic communication
- Sequencer: Host tempo sync with internal timing fallback

## Next Steps

1. Stage 2: DSP Implementation (audio processing) - Run /continue MuSam
2. Review architecture.md for DSP component specifications
3. Pause here

## Files Created

- plugins/MuSam/.ideas/architecture.md
- plugins/MuSam/.ideas/plan.md
- plugins/MuSam/CMakeLists.txt
- plugins/MuSam/Source/PluginProcessor.h
- plugins/MuSam/Source/PluginProcessor.cpp
- plugins/MuSam/Source/PluginEditor.h
- plugins/MuSam/Source/PluginEditor.cpp

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Pitch shifting: Granular synthesis (not phase vocoder) for better performance
- Sample loading: Full sample in memory (not streaming) for simplicity
- Sequencer timing: Host tempo sync preferred, internal timing fallback
- Complexity: 4.2 (Complex) - requires phased implementation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- DSP: 4 phases (Core Playback → Per-Region Processing → Pitch Shifting → Sequencer)
- GUI: 3 phases (Layout → Parameter Binding → Advanced UI)
- Total: 7 phases with incremental commits

**Risk Assessment:**
- Highest risk: Pitch shifting quality (granular synthesis may have artifacts)
- Mitigation: Fallback to phase vocoder if quality insufficient
- Other risks: Sequencer timing, sample loading performance
