## Stage 0: Research - COMPLETED

**Completed:** 2025-11-12

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ DSP architecture specification created (architecture.md)
- ✅ Researched JUCE sample playback (AudioFormatManager, AudioFormatReader)
- ✅ Researched envelope generators (juce::ADSR)
- ✅ Researched tilt filter implementation (cascaded shelving filters)
- ✅ Researched pitch shifting (variable-rate resampling)
- ✅ Studied professional samplers (Battery 4, Geist2, Kontakt)

**Key Decisions:**
- Sample playback: Load into AudioSampleBuffer, use linear interpolation for pitch shift
- Envelope: ADSR with fixed sustain=0 (decay-focused, percussive)
- Tilt filter: Cascaded low-shelf + high-shelf at 1kHz pivot
- Multi-output: 18 channels (2 main + 16 individual)
- Voice architecture: juce::Synthesiser with 8 custom voices

## Next: Stage 1 (Planning)

**Requirements:**
- ⚠️ Missing: parameter-spec.md (BLOCKING - required for complexity calculation)
- ✅ Present: architecture.md
- ✅ Present: creative-brief.md

**Action Required:**
Parameter-spec.md must be created before Stage 1 can proceed.

**To proceed:**
Create parameter-spec.md with all 73 parameters, then continue with Stage 1.
