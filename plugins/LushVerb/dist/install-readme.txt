GATEKEEPER BYPASS (CRITICAL!)

Since this plugin is unsigned, macOS will block it the first time. Follow these steps:

1. Open your DAW (Logic Pro, Ableton, FL Studio, etc.)
2. Load LushVerb as an audio effect
3. macOS will show: "LushVerb cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"
4. Click "Cancel" or "OK"
5. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security
6. Scroll down to the Security section
7. You'll see: "LushVerb was blocked from use"
8. Click "Open Anyway" or "Allow Anyway"
9. Restart your DAW
10. Load LushVerb again - it will now work!

This only needs to be done ONCE per format (VST3 and AU separately).

QUICK START

After installation, try these presets:

Ethereal Vocal Reverb:
- SIZE: 8.0s, DAMPING: 40%, SHIMMER: 35%, MIX: 25%
