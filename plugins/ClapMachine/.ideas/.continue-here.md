# Resume Point

## Current State: UI Mockup v2 In Progress

UI mockup design iteration paused at v2. User requested to pause and return later.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Dual-section 808-style clap with independent filtering
- Parameters specified: 18 total controls (flam, body, mix/output sections)
- UI vision captured: Dual-panel layout, vintage aesthetic with modern clarity
- Use cases identified: House production, retro 808, experimental textures

**UI Mockup:** v2 Complete (iteration paused)
- v1: Initial design with earth tone aesthetic, waveform display
- v2: Improved grid alignment, uniform knob sizing (65px), precise spacing
- Layout: 800x600, dual panels with waveform header, mix strip bottom
- Aesthetic: TapeAge-inspired earth tones, fractal noise texture, corner screws
- Grid: 120px spacing between columns, perfect vertical/horizontal alignment

## Next Steps When Resuming

1. Review v2-ui-test.html in browser to verify layout
2. Refine if needed (create v3) or finalize v2
3. Generate implementation files (after design approval)
4. Optionally save as aesthetic template for reuse
5. Proceed to implementation (`/implement ClapMachine`)

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: Dual-section architecture (flam generator + noise body)
- Dual multimode filtering: Independent LP/BP/HP filters with resonance per section
- Wide parameter ranges: 0-100ms flam timing, +/- 24 semitone pitch, 2-5 adjustable layers
- MIDI response: Velocity → volume only (simple, predictable)
- Presets: 3-5 starting points for common use cases

**UI Design Decisions:**
- Window: 800x600, non-resizable
- All knobs: Uniform 65px diameter
- Grid alignment: Precise columns at [70, 190, 310] for FLAM, [470, 590, 710] for BODY (relative to window)
- Row spacing: Row 1 at y=150, Row 2 at y=300
- Mix strip: 4 knobs at [110, 280, 450, 620], y=520
- Color scheme: Unified earth tones (beige/tan/brown), no color coding per panel
- Waveform: Dual-layer visualization (blue-teal flam + orange-amber body)
- Vintage details: Corner screws, fractal noise texture, recessed panels

**Files Created:**
- plugins/ClapMachine/.ideas/creative-brief.md
- plugins/ClapMachine/.ideas/mockups/v1-ui.yaml
- plugins/ClapMachine/.ideas/mockups/v1-ui-test.html
- plugins/ClapMachine/.ideas/mockups/v2-ui.yaml (current)
- plugins/ClapMachine/.ideas/mockups/v2-ui-test.html (current)
- PLUGINS.md entry added

**Architecture Notes:**
- Flam section: Layered transients with timing spread, stereo width, independent filter
- Body section: Noise generator (white/pink/brown) with tone, decay, independent filter
- Mix stage: Balance, drive/saturation, pitch shift, output level
- Each section has full multimode filtering (LP/BP/HP + resonance)

**Known Issues to Address:**
- v1 had overlapping controls and poor alignment (resolved in v2)
- Need to verify v2 spacing in browser before finalizing
