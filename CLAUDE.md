# PLUGIN FREEDOM SYSTEM - Plugin Development System

## Terms Explained (Plain-Language Glossary)

When technical terms appear in the system, they refer to these concepts:

**Audio Plugin Terms:**

- **APVTS** → Parameter System (handles knobs, sliders, and switches in the plugin UI)
- **VST3/AU** → Plugin Format (how DAWs like Logic Pro or Ableton load your plugin)
- **pluginval** → Validation Tool (automated testing tool that checks for crashes and errors)
- **processBlock** → Audio Processing Function (the main function that processes audio samples)
- **DSP** → Audio Processing Engine (the code that transforms audio signals)

**JUCE Framework Terms:**

- **JUCE** → Cross-Platform Audio Framework (C++ library for building audio plugins)
- **WebView** → Modern UI System (lets you build plugin interfaces using HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Standalone** → Desktop Application Mode (run plugin as standalone app, not in DAW)

**Workflow Terms:**

- **Milestone Language** → User-facing progress indicators (Build System Ready → Audio Engine Working → UI Integrated → Plugin Complete)
- **Contract Files** → Design Documents (creative-brief.md, parameter-spec.md, architecture.md, plan.md)
- **Checkpoint** → Progress Save Point (commit code, update state, present decision menu)
- **Subagent** → Specialized Worker (focused AI agent for specific implementation milestone)

**System Terms:**

- **Drift** → Design Mismatch (when mockup doesn't match creative brief)
- **Tier** → Investigation Complexity Level (how deep to analyze a problem: quick/moderate/deep)
- **Required Reading** → Critical Patterns (juce8-critical-patterns.md - common mistakes to avoid)

**Internal vs User-Facing:**

- **Internal:** Stage numbers (1-3) used for routing logic, never shown to users
- **User-facing:** Milestone names (Build System Ready, Audio Engine Working, UI Integrated) shown in all menus and messages

When these terms appear in the system, the plain-language equivalent will be shown on first use:

- Example: "Setting up APVTS (Parameter System - handles your knobs and sliders)..."
- Example: "Running pluginval (Validation Tool - checks for crashes)..."
- Example: "Building VST3 (Plugin Format - how DAWs load your plugin)..."

## System Components

- **Scripts**: `scripts/` - Build and installation automation
  - build-and-install.sh - Centralized build automation (7-phase pipeline: validate, build, install, verify)
  - verify-backup.sh - Backup integrity verification (Phase 7)
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` - Each skill follows Anthropic's pattern with `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `assets/` subdirectories
  - plugin-workflow, plugin-ideation, plugin-improve (enhanced with regression testing), ui-mockup, context-resume, plugin-testing, plugin-lifecycle, build-automation, troubleshooting-docs, deep-research, system-setup, workflow-reconciliation
- **Subagents**: `.claude/agents/` - research-planning-agent, foundation-shell-agent, dsp-agent, gui-agent, validation-agent, ui-design-agent, ui-finalization-agent, troubleshoot-agent
- **Commands**: `.claude/commands/` - /setup, /dream, /implement, /improve, /continue, /test, /install-plugin, /uninstall, /show-standalone, /doc-fix, /research, /clean, /reconcile, /clear-cache, /reset-to-ideation, /destroy, /add-critical-pattern, /package, /plan
- **Hooks**: `.claude/hooks/` - Validation gates (PostToolUse, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PreCompact, SessionStart)
- **Knowledge Base**: `troubleshooting/` - Dual-indexed (by-plugin + by-symptom) problem solutions

### Build System Architecture

**CRITICAL: Workspace-Level Build System**

All plugins share a unified CMake workspace build system:

- **Workspace Root**: All CMake commands must run from `/path/to/plugin-freedom-system/`
- **Plugin CMakeLists.txt**: Individual plugin CMakeLists.txt files are NOT standalone projects
- **JUCE Dependency**: Plugins depend on parent workspace CMakeLists.txt for JUCE setup and configuration

**Build Commands (from workspace root):**
```bash
# Configure workspace (first time or after CMakeLists.txt changes)
cmake -B build -G Ninja

# Build specific plugin formats
cmake --build build --target PluginName_VST3
cmake --build build --target PluginName_AU
cmake --build build --target PluginName_Standalone

# Build all formats
scripts/build-and-install.sh PluginName
```

**Standalone App Locations:**
- Debug: `build/plugins/[PluginName]/[PluginName]_artefacts/Debug/Standalone/[PluginName].app`
- Release: `build/plugins/[PluginName]/[PluginName]_artefacts/Release/Standalone/[PluginName].app`

**Common Build Errors:**
- ❌ `cd plugins/Sektor && cmake -B build` → FAILS with "Unknown CMake command juce_add_plugin"
- ❌ `cmake -B plugins/Sektor/build -S plugins/Sektor` → FAILS (missing parent JUCE setup)
- ✅ `cmake --build build --target Sektor_Standalone` → WORKS (from workspace root)

**When to Use /show-standalone:**
- Quick UI testing during development
- Visual inspection of layout and controls
- MIDI/parameter testing without DAW
- See `/show-standalone` command documentation for details

### Workflow Modes

- **Manual Mode** (default): Present decision menus at each checkpoint for user control
- **Express Mode**: Auto-progress through implementation without intermediate menus
- **Configuration**: `.claude/preferences.json` - Set workflow mode, auto-test, auto-install, auto-package options
- **Command flags**: `--express` or `--manual` override preferences (e.g., `/implement PluginName --express`)
- **Safety**: Express mode drops to manual on any error

## Contracts (Single Source of Truth)

- `plugins/[Name]/.ideas/` - creative-brief.md (vision), parameter-spec.md (parameters), architecture.md (DSP design), plan.md (implementation strategy)
- **State**: PLUGINS.md (all plugins), .continue-here.md (active workflow)
- **Templates**: Contract templates stored in skill assets (`.claude/skills/*/assets/`)

## Key Principles

1. **Contracts are immutable during implementation** - All stages reference the same specs (zero drift)
   - Technical enforcement via PostToolUse hook (blocks Edit/Write to contract files during Stages 1-3)
   - Checksum validation in SubagentStop hook (detects unauthorized modifications)
   - Cross-contract consistency validation (parameter counts, DSP components, complexity scores)
2. **Dispatcher pattern** - Each subagent runs in fresh context (no accumulation)
3. **Discovery through play** - Features found via slash command autocomplete and decision menus
4. **Instructed routing** - Commands expand to prompts, Claude invokes skills
5. **Required Reading injection** - Critical patterns (`juce8-critical-patterns.md`) are mandatory reading for all subagents to prevent repeat mistakes
6. **Proactive validation** - Errors caught early (dependencies at start, brief sync before Stage 1, silent failures at compile-time)
7. **Automatic continuous validation** - validation-agent runs after each implementation stage (Stages 1-3) with enhanced runtime validation (compile-time + pluginval tests). Validation is blocking - errors must be fixed before progressing to next stage. No optional testing.

## Proactive Validation (Error Prevention)

The system prevents late-stage failures through multi-layer validation:

**Session Start (SessionStart hook):**

- Validates all dependencies before any work (Python, jq, CMake, Xcode, JUCE, git)
- Reports critical errors with actionable fix commands
- Prevents wasted work before discovering missing dependencies

**Stage 0→1 Transition (brief sync):**

- Automatic update of creative brief from finalized mockup
- Ensures contracts reflect final UI design before Stage 1
- No manual reconciliation needed (mockup is source of truth)

**During Implementation (PostToolUse hook):**

- Contract immutability enforcement (blocks modifications to .ideas/\*.md during Stages 1-3)
- Real-time safety checks (processBlock validation)
- Silent failure pattern detection (12+ known patterns from juce8-critical-patterns.md)
- Blocks commits with patterns that compile but fail at runtime

**After Subagent Completion (SubagentStop hook):**

- Contract checksum validation (verifies contracts unchanged during Stages 1-3)
- Cross-contract consistency checks (parameter counts, DSP components, references)
- Stage-specific deterministic validation (foundation-shell, DSP, GUI)

**Checkpoint Completion (plugin-workflow):**

- Verifies all checkpoint steps succeeded before presenting decision menu
- Detects incomplete state updates (missing handoff, status, timeline, commit)
- Prevents state corruption from partial checkpoint failures

**Result:** 90% reduction in late-stage failures per SYSTEM-AUDIT-REPORT.md

## Checkpoint Protocol (System-Wide)

At every significant completion point (stage complete, phase complete, files generated, contract created):

1. Auto-commit changes (if in workflow)
2. Update state files (.continue-here.md, PLUGINS.md)
3. **Verify checkpoint completion** (all steps succeeded)
4. **Check workflow mode** (express or manual)
5. Present decision menu or auto-progress based on mode

### Manual Mode (Default)

Present numbered decision menu and WAIT for user response:

✓ [Completion statement]

What's next?

1. [Primary action] (recommended)
2. [Secondary action]
3. [Discovery option] ← User discovers [feature]
4. [Alternative path]
5. Other

Choose (1-5): \_

### Express Mode

Auto-progress to next stage without menu:

✓ [Current milestone] → [Next milestone]...

[Stage execution begins immediately]

**Final menu always appears** (even in express mode) after Stage 3 completes and validation passes.

### Workflow Mode Configuration

**File:** `.claude/preferences.json`

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "mode": "express",
    "auto_test": false,
    "auto_install": true,
    "auto_package": false
  }
}
```

**Mode options:**

- **"manual"** (default): Present decision menus at all checkpoints (Stages 0, 1, 2, 3)
- **"express"**: Auto-progress through stages without menus

**Command-line overrides:**

- `/implement PluginName --express`: Force express mode for this run
- `/implement PluginName --manual`: Force manual mode for this run
- `/continue PluginName --express`: Resume in express mode
- `/continue PluginName --manual`: Resume in manual mode

**Precedence:** Command flag > preferences.json > default ("manual")

**Mode persistence:** Mode stored in `.continue-here.md` for resume scenarios

**Safety:** Express mode drops to manual on ANY error (build failures, test failures, etc.)

**Auto-actions:**

- `auto_test`: DEPRECATED (validation now automatic during workflow)
- `auto_install`: Install to system folders after Stage 3 validation passes
- `auto_package`: Create PKG installer after installation

See `.claude/preferences-README.md` for complete documentation.

### Checkpoint Applies To

- All workflow stages (0-3)
- All subagent completions
- Validation-agent completions (after each stage)
- Contract creation (creative-brief, mockups, parameter-spec)
- Any point where user needs to decide next action

Do NOT use AskUserQuestion tool for decision menus - use inline numbered lists as shown above.

## Subagent Invocation Protocol

All implementation stages use the dispatcher pattern. The system uses milestone names for user-facing messages and internal stage numbers (0-3) for routing:

**Implementation Milestones:**

- **Research Complete** (Stage 0) → research-planning-agent (plugin-planning skill)
  - Creates architecture.md (DSP specification)
  - Creates plan.md (implementation strategy)

- **Build System Ready** (Stage 1) → foundation-shell-agent (plugin-workflow skill)
  - Generates CMakeLists.txt, project structure
  - Implements all APVTS parameters from parameter-spec.md
  - Followed by validation-agent (automatic, blocking)

- **Audio Engine Working** (Stage 2) → dsp-agent (plugin-workflow skill)
  - Implements processBlock and DSP algorithms
  - Connects parameters to audio processing
  - Followed by validation-agent (automatic, blocking)

- **UI Integrated** (Stage 3) → gui-agent (plugin-workflow skill)
  - Creates WebView interface from mockup
  - Binds UI controls to APVTS parameters
  - Followed by validation-agent (automatic, blocking with runtime tests)
  - After validation passes: Plugin complete, ready to install

The orchestrating skills delegate to subagents, they do **not** implement directly.

After subagent completes:

1. Read subagent's return message
2. Commit changes
3. Update .continue-here.md
4. Update PLUGINS.md
5. Present numbered decision menu
6. Wait for user response

This ensures consistent checkpoint behavior and clean separation of concerns.

## Workflow Entry Points

- First-time setup: `/setup` (validate and configure dependencies)
- New plugin: `/dream` → `/plan` → `/implement`
- Resume work: `/continue [PluginName]`
- Modify existing: `/improve [PluginName]`
- Test plugin: `/test [PluginName]`

## GUI-Optional Flow (Phase 7 Enhancement)

**Purpose:** Plugins can skip custom UI (Stage 3) and ship as "headless" plugins using DAW-provided parameter controls. Custom UI can be added later via `/improve`.

**Benefits:**

- **Faster iteration:** Test DSP immediately after Stage 2 without waiting for UI
- **Progressive enhancement:** Add GUI later when ready via `/improve [PluginName]`
- **Flexibility:** User decides when/if to build custom UI

**Workflow:**

After Stage 2 (DSP) completes, user chooses:

1. **Add custom UI** - Create WebView interface (existing behavior, 15 min)
2. **Ship headless** - Use DAW controls only (new option, 1 min)

**Headless path:**

- Generates minimal PluginEditor (shows plugin name, instructs to use DAW controls)
- Proceeds to Stage 3 validation (automatic)
- Plugin marked as v1.0.0 (Headless)
- All parameters exposed to DAW automation
- No custom UI overhead (smaller binary, faster compile)

**GUI addition via /improve:**

- `/improve [PluginName]` detects headless plugins
- Offers "Create custom UI" option
- Invokes ui-mockup → gui-agent (same as Stage 3)
- Version bumped to v1.1.0 (minor version - new feature)
- Backward compatible (existing automation/presets unaffected)

**State management:**

- New field `gui_type: "headless" | "webview"` in .continue-here.md
- Backward compatible (defaults to "webview" if field missing)
- Used by /improve to detect headless plugins

**Templates:**

- `plugins/TEMPLATE-HEADLESS-EDITOR/` - Minimal PluginEditor templates
- Automatically substituted with plugin name during generation

**Entry point:** After Stage 2 completion (GUI decision gate in plugin-workflow)
