  Last updated: 2025-11-12T14:30:00Z

✓ parameter-spec.md
  Status: LOCKED AND CURRENT

✗ PLUGINS.md
  Current: 🚧 Stage 4
  Expected: ✅ Working (after UI implementation)
  Action: UPDATE status emoji

Git Status:

✓ Staged: None
✗ Unstaged: 5 files
  - plugins/DriveVerb/.ideas/mockups/v1-PluginEditor.h

Proposed Actions:

2. Stage all 5 mockup implementation files
3. Commit with message: "feat(DriveVerb): Complete UI mockup v1 with implementation files"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What should I do?
1. Fix everything automatically - Execute all updates and commit
2. Show me the diffs first - Preview file changes before committing
3. Fix files only (no commit) - Update state files but don't stage/commit
4. Update .continue-here.md only - Minimal checkpoint
5. Skip reconciliation - I'll handle it manually
6. Other

Choose (1-6): _
```

### User Choice: 1 (Fix automatically)

### Remediation Output

```
Reconciliation complete:
✓ Updated PLUGINS.md status to ✅
✓ Staged 5 files
✓ Committed: feat(DriveVerb): Complete UI mockup v1 with implementation files

All state files synchronized. Workflow can resume without context loss.
